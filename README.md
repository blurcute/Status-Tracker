#### Status-Tracker

Status Tracker is exactly what it says. As a result of having a certain status, the bot will reward the user with a role. This bot's script isn't the cleanest, but it gets the job done and if you aren't very experienced, it's better than nothing. This can be used when giving away prizes or just wanting to let your members show off how much they support your server.
